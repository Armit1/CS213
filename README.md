# CS213-proj1

Right now there's minimal code, this repo is starting off as basically a skeleton of the program and we can both add code where we see fit.

A quick note, we should try to follow the naming conventions and parameters for methods given to us 
in the assignment document as close as possible. Also I think we have to adhere to the attributes 
given to us in the document. The only attributes we are allowed to add are constants as far as I am aware.
Helper methods should be okay.
